                        <p>_____</p>
                        <p>We have been wanting to give some love to the catering side of Sacred Strawberry, but it has always seemed to take a back burner to other stuff we have going on.  Finally, for the month of August we bring you the Sacred Strawberry Cosmic Catering Menu!!  We are starting off fairly simple to gauge interest, so expect to see the menu grow with time

Sacred Strawberry also offers wild edible consultations.  We will come to your garden and tell you what you have growing, how you could optimize certain plants in your garden, as well as how to prepare and use the plants we find.  We lead free wild plant walks, so come along on one of those!</p>
