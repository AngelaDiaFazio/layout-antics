                        <p>_____</p>
                        <p>We have been wanting to give some love to the catering side of Sacred Strawberry, but it has always seemed to take a back burner to other stuff we have going on.  Finally, for the month of August we bring you the Sacred Strawberry Cosmic Catering Menu!!  We are starting off fairly simple to gauge interest, so expect to see the menu grow with time
                        </p>
